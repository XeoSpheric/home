This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app). It runs thanks to [Tailwindcss](https://tailwindcss.com/), [Supabase](https://supabase.com/), and a loving wife to support me. 

## Hello There

General Kenobi! Welcome to my website! Here I am trying to develop a website that show top tier React/Nextjs coding practices and secure api's to run a functional and powerful blog. I am an eternal learner, who constantly is pushing myself to do better and not just settle for a round about way someone else did. I want to learn the best ways to write things to push fast, functional, secure, and b-e-a-u-tiful content.
